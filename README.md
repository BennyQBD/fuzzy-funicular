# Initial Readme!

### Project setup steps
- Git repository
- Add initial README.md. Markdown is preferred format due to allowing readable stylized plain text and easy conversion to rendered formats.
- Add COPYING. Always remember *YOU* are the copyright holder no matter what license you use! That means you can change license at any time, or give different license terms to different people, etc. When in doubt, I recommend AGPL as default license for three reasons
  1) It's compatible with virtually every other free or open source license, which means there's minimal legal headache when considering whether you're legally able to use library X or example code Y.
  2) When talking to people, my experience is people generally want others to be able to use the code how they want, but they *don't* want others suing them, claiming credit for their work, or doing anything else that blatantly undermines their intention to openly share the code. To my determination, AGPL is a better match for these requirements than any other open source license.
  3) You can always change license later if you want. If you do change license however, it's better to change from a less permissive to a more permissive license than vice-versa.
  4) One exception: If you're making a very small piece of software (no more than a few hundred SLOC), then the permissive MIT license is a superior default choice. 
- Choose programming language: If the task obviously demands a specific language and no other will do, then use that language. Otherwise, when in doubt use TypeScript. It's broadly applicable to many application and usage areas since it's JavaScript-based, but more importantly according to Software Engineering research paper "A Large Scale Study of Programming Languages and Code Quality in Github" TypeScript is among the most productive and low-defect of all common programming languages by a notable margin. Any alternative language should need a pretty compelling case in it's favor to overcome that prior.
